run my project after typing make:
1. ./P0 < P0_test1
   Error message (from the shell, not your program)

2. ./P0 < P0_test1.f1
   Three empty files out.preorder out.inorder out.postorder are created

3. ./P0 P0_test2

4. ./P0 P0_test3

5. ./P0
  Type on the keyboard
  123 Enter ^D

Output does not have any a specific error running these above five tests.

I also check the wrong data if validating.
  For example a number is less than 10, and data contains letters or a special character.

My code works well with data over multiple lines.
